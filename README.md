# MSP432-Interface
Creating an Interface for the MSP432 Microcontroller in C that allowed for RGB control, digital input, and temperature readings without utilizing scanf or printf.

- For the RGB control, the color of the LED, the toggle time, and the number of blinks/flashes could be selected.
- For the digital input, the program would need to recognize the pressing of certain buttons on the microcontroller and inform the user of which button(s) were being pressed if any.
- For the temperature readings, a temperature value recorded from the microcontroller would need to be displayed every second in both Celsius and Fahrenheit for the user specified number of times.
- The text displayed for the interface in this project could also not utilize either of C's printf and scanf functions, and as such we were required to create our own working versions of both these functions to complete the projects interface.
